# **Chapter VI: Q&A – Answering the Big Questions**

No architecture is complete without addressing the "why," "how," and "what about this scenario?" questions that inevitably arise. This chapter tackles the most common queries about Clean Cut Architecture (CCA), so you can walk away with clarity and confidence.

### **Why Create Another Architecture?**

Clean Cut Architecture takes inspiration from Clean Architecture and Vertical Slice, but adds its own flavor. It's all about **structured simplicity**-making your software easy to understand, easy to work with, and not a headache to extend later.

CCA brings together the best of both worlds and adds its own spin by focusing on:

- **Clear boundaries** that make navigating your code a breeze, making it easy to see where things fit and reduce cognitive load.
- **Use Cases** as the stars of the show, so your system's purpose shines through, ensuring the system's purpose drives its structure.
- **Simplified rules** that help you make decisions without second-guessing yourself.

Clean Cut Architecture aims to bridge the ideas from previous architectures with more of a focus on clarity and usability. The result is a framework that delivers the benefits of both approaches while keeping things simple, intuitive, and adaptable to real-world projects.

It's not about reinventing the wheel-it's about giving you a set of tools to build something strong, scalable, and **fun to work on.**

### **Isn't All This Overkill for Small Projects?**

Not necessarily. Think of CCA like a toolkit. For small projects, you might only pull out the essentials—maybe just the a `/presentation` directory with an inner `/application` module to keep things tidy. As your project grows, the framework grows with you, saving you from the dreaded "refactor everything" phase down the line. You can take `/application` out of `/presentation` and go from there.

Clarity doesn’t care about project size. Even in a 10-line project, knowing where things belong saves time and headaches. It’s about building with intention, no matter the scale.

### **How Do You Avoid Turning the Shared Boundary into a Dumping Ground?**

Ah, the “shared dumping ground”—the bane of many architectures. Here’s the trick: the Shared zone is a exclusive one. Components don’t get in just because they’re “kinda useful”.

To make it past the velvet rope, a component needs to:

- Prove it’s valuable across multiple Use Cases.
- Clearly not belong to any one specific boundary.

Here is a nice practical exercise I like to do. If I find myself copying/pasting code constantly with very little to zero changes, then that component might be getting a ticket into `/shared`.

The golden rule: **don’t share unless you have to**. This is the **Delayed Sharing** principle. It forces you to think carefully before adding something, so Shared doesn’t turn into a chaotic junk drawer.

---

### **How Do You Handle Cross-Cutting Concerns Like Logging?**

Logging is one of those sneaky things that can sprawl across your codebase if you’re not careful. In CCA, logging belongs in the Shared boundary but with strict rules:

- It shouldn’t drag boundaries into each other’s business.
- It needs to stay lightweight and easy to use.

Picture this: a simple logger interface in `/application/shared/logger`. Just the essentials—LogInfo, LogError, and friends. Implementations can live right next to it. And now, anyone with access to Application has access to Logger.

Good news: most languages, like C#, have built-in logging solutions. But even if they didn’t, this approach is simple and intuitive.

### **What About Real-World Constraints? Tight Deadlines? Legacy Systems?**

Clean Cut Architecture isn’t here to complicate your life; it’s here to make things easier. Let’s talk strategy:

- **Tight Deadlines:** Start small. Define your Use Cases, keep your dependencies clean, and leave room to grow. Even implementing just the Application boundary can make a big difference. If you're using C#, this repository includes a handy template in /templates/CSharp/SimpleTemplate to help you hit the ground running. Not using C#? No worries—use it for inspiration. Start with an Application directory (with a nested UseCases folder) and a Presentation directory to organize your code.

- **Legacy Systems:** These are always a mixed bag, right? The first step is understanding what you’re working with. Talk to your team, check the tickets (if they exist), peek at the version history, and dive into the code. If it’s a mess, focus on pinpointing the presentation components first.

For example, if it’s an API, track down all the endpoints. Map them out and start piecing together what the system does. From there, you can draft theoretical Use Cases and begin wrapping legacy functionality into CCA concepts.

But here’s the kicker: you don’t need to refactor the entire system overnight. Document what you’ve learned, map out the Use Cases, and focus on the immediate change you need to make. Incremental improvement beats no improvement, especially under time pressure.

The big takeaway? Clean Cut Architecture is a guide, not a set of handcuffs. Deadlines, bugs, and shifting priorities all play a role in how much you can adopt at any given moment. Your job is to strike a balance. Sometimes that means studying the codebase thoroughly; other times, it means solving the problem quickly and saving the deep dive for later.

### **How Does CCA Help a Team, Not Just the Code?**

Great architecture isn’t just about code—it’s about the people writing it. CCA makes life easier for teams in a few key ways:

- **Shared Standards:** With CCA, the team has a clear framework for structuring software. It gets everyone on the same page, while still leaving room for team-specific nuances.

- **Faster Onboarding:** New developers can jump in more confidently when the system has a logical structure. It’s like walking into a tidy kitchen—everything’s where you’d expect.

- **Purpose-Driven Focus:** The Use Cases mentality helps teams focus on what the system is supposed to do, rather than getting lost in technical details like API endpoints.

- **Better Collaboration:** Clear boundaries mean fewer accidental conflicts. Frontend, backend, and DevOps folks can work more independently while understanding how their pieces fit into the bigger picture.

At the end of the day, a well-structured system reduces friction—both technical and human.

### **What’s the One Thing to Remember About CCA?**

If you’re only going to remember one thing, let it be this:

    Make your system obvious on what it does, and simple on how it does it.

This isn’t about adding complexity or imposing rigid rules. It’s about clarity. The more intuitive your system is, the easier it is to understand, maintain, and extend. CCA helps developers focus on what matters most: solving problems.

---

## **Closing Thoughts**

Clean Cut Architecture isn’t just a set of rules; it’s a mindset. It’s about creating software that feels natural to work with—for both humans and machines. By embracing CCA, you’re not just organizing your code better; you’re building systems that are easier to live with and evolve over time.

So, what’s next? Get out there and experiment. Try CCA on your next project and see how it works for you. And if you’ve got feedback or experiences to share, this repository is here for that.

Remember, Clean Cut Architecture is a starting point—not a one-size-fits-all solution. Adapt it, shape it, and make it work for your needs. At the end of the day, **it’s your project, and you’re the one who ensures it thrives.**
