Clean Cut Architecture (CCA) is an evolving approach that blends the principles of **Clean Architecture** and **Vertical Slice Architecture** to achieve **clarity**, **simplicity**, and a focus on **business intent**.

This repository serves as both a **knowledge base** (docs) and a collection of **practical templates and examples** for implementing CCA in your projects.

## Why Clean Cut

Over my years as a .NET engineer, I’ve been inspired by the structured approach of Clean Architecture and the simplicity of Vertical Slice Architecture. I often found myself blending the two approaches into something that worked better for my projects—something I now call **Clean Cut Architecture**.

Clean Cut Architecture aims to:

- Make the **business purpose of your code immediately obvious** (Screaming Architecture).
- Focus on **use case-driven development**.
- Provide **cohesive slices** that bring together domain logic, infrastructure, and presentation.
- Balance **simplicity** and **scalability**, allowing systems to grow without unnecessary complexity.

## What is in this Repo?

### Documentation

The `/docs` folder contains:

- An **overview** of Clean Cut Architecture principles.
- A guide on how to structure your projects using CCA.
- Comparisons with Clean and Vertical Slice Architecture.

### Templates and Examples

The `/templates` folder provides:

- A **starter project template** with a basic CCA setup.
- **Examples** of common patterns and use cases implemented in CCA.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fernando-jimenez-dev/clean-cut-architecture.git
```

### Step 2: Explore the Docs

Head to the `/docs` folder to understand the core principles and how to get started with Clean Cut Architecture.

### Step 3: Try the Templates

Check out the `/templates` folder for project setups you can adapt to your own use cases.

## Roadmap

- ☑️ Set up repository and first ReadMe.
- ☐ Initial documentation on principles and concepts.
- ☐ Add a starter project template.
- ☐ Provide more real-world examples.
- ☐ Create guides for integrating CCA into existing systems.
- ☐ Open the project for community feedback and contributions.

## Contributing

For now, this repository is a **work in progress**, but feel free to open issues for suggestions or ideas. Contributions will be welcomed in the future.
