This directory contains practical templates to help you kickstart your journey with Clean Cut Architecture. These templates serve as a foundation for implementing CCA principles in your projects. Because I am a C# developer, I will start with templates in the C# language. I'd keep the door open to expand language support in the future.

## Templates Included

1. **Simple Template**:
   - A minimal starting point for new projects.
   - Includes sample directories and files following the CCA structure.
