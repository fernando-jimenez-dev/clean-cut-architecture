# SimpleProject Template

This template provides a starting point for implementing the **Clean Cut Architecture (CCA)** principles. It includes:

1. A basic folder structure.
2. An example use case: **Check Pulse**.

## Example Use Case: Check Pulse

- **Purpose:** Verifies the application's operational status.
- **Input:** No input required.
- **Output:** Whether the use case execution succeeded or not.
- **Endpoint:** Exposed via `GET /check-pulse`.

## How to Use

1. Replace the example use case (`CheckPulseUseCase`) with your own business-specific use cases.
2. Extend the template as needed to fit your application's domain and requirements.
3. Follow the CCA principles of screaming intent, cohesion, and isolation.
